# Event Watcher Server

This Express server listens for `playerVerified` events from a smart contract and filters them based on the message value.

## Features

- **Event Filtering**: Only stores events where `message` parsed as integer is > 0
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes events older than 1 minute
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints to access filtered events
- **Real-time Processing**: Continues to process events on Flare network regardless of filtering

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

### Development mode (with auto-restart)
```bash
npm run dev
```

    "playerAddress": "0x4b4b30e2E7c6463b03CdFFD6c42329D357205334",
    "firstName": "NEYMAR",
    "lastName": "JUNIOR",

}
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:
```
CELO_ALFAJORES_RPC=your_celo_rpc_url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
PORT=3001 (optional, defaults to 3001)
```

## Event Filtering Logic

- Events with `message` value â‰¤ 0 are logged but not stored
- Events with `message` value > 0 are stored in the global list
- Stored events are automatically removed after 1 minute
- All events are processed on the Flare network regardless of filtering

## Example Response

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "events": [
    {
      "message": "276",
      "playerAddress": "0x4b4b30e2E7c6463b03CdFFD6c42329D357205334",
      "firstName": "NEYMAR",
      "lastName": "JUNIOR",
      "nationality": "USA",
      "dateOfBirth": "05-02-92",
      "gender": "M",
      "timestamp": 1703123456789
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2023-12-21T10:30:56.789Z"
}
